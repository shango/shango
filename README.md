## Experience

I’m a former VFX artist now transitioning into technical writing, building on over a decade of experience documenting complex production workflows in fast-paced visual effects environments.

During my time in VFX, I often created internal documentation to help teams stay aligned—from setting up color pipelines and rendering configurations to onboarding new artists. I’ve worked closely with both engineers and artists, including collaborating with color science teams at Netflix to document pipeline processes clearly and accurately.

I enjoy breaking down complex systems and making them easy to understand. Most of my documentation lives in Markdown, Google Docs, or exported PDFs, often versioned through Git workflows. I currently maintain a writing portfolio on GitHub Pages, powered by Jekyll.

I have hands-on experience with Python, C, and version control, and have taken college-level Computer Science courses. I'm planning to pursue a Master’s in CS soon to deepen my technical foundation.

Right now, I’m looking for full-time technical writing roles—especially with teams building developer tools, media technology, or VFX software.
